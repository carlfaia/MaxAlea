# Max.alea: A Stochastic Toolkit for Max

## Introduction

**Max.alea** is a comprehensive collection of stochastic tools and algorithms for the Max environment. Originally inspired by Mikhail Malt's PatchWork library from the early 1990s, Max.alea has evolved into a dynamic, real-time toolkit for experimental and creative work with probabilistic processes.

## Key Features

- **Real-time manipulation of stochastic processes**
- **Diverse collection of random distributions and algorithms**
- **Implementations of random walks and 1/f noise**
- **Utility objects designed specifically for stochastic operations**
- **Consistent, high-quality random number generation**

## History and Development

Initiated in 1996, Max.alea has undergone several iterations to keep pace with evolving Macintosh architecture. The latest version, completely rewritten using the Min-DevKit in `C++`, ensures compatibility with modern Max environments on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. While primarily developed for macOS, the source code is available on GitHub, facilitating potential Windows ports by the community.

## Unique Approach to Randomness

Max.alea employs a seeded random number generator based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm, ensuring high-quality, non-repeating sequences of random numbers. This approach differs from the default random functions in Max and other environments, offering more robust and diverse random behaviors.

## Using the Library

1. Place the externals in your Max Packages folder.
2. Access help files directly from Max by right-clicking on objects.
3. Explore the included example patches for practical applications.

## Components

- **Random Distributions** (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, Weibull)
- **Random Walk and 1/f Noise Algorithms**
- **Markov Chain Analysis and Generation**
- **Data Mapping and Scaling Utilities**
- **Bounded Random Value Generators**

## Applications

- Algorithmic Composition
- Generative Art and Sound Design
- Interactive Installations
- Data Sonification
- Stochastic Modeling in Various Fields

## Future Development

Max.alea is an ongoing project. Planned additions include more stochastic models, enhanced utilities, and comprehensive documentation. Community feedback and contributions are welcome.
